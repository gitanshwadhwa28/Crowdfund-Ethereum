CrowdFund is an innovative application built using Solidity, React.js, Next.js, and Bootstrap. It differs from existing applications because unlike other applications transactions are completed after the approval of all contributors in a particular campaign. This feature ensures transparency and a sense of community among the contributors, leading to a more trustworthy and secure platform.
